# EnergyPrediction
Conservation of energy is becoming increasingly important, and buildings are being retrofitted to reduce energy consumption. However, the question that remains is how to quantitatively measure the benefits of such investments in terms of energy saved. The purpose of this project is to provide an end to end appraoch of predicting counterfactual energy consumption levels (energy consumption levels without retrofit) using machine learning models. Accurately predicting such counterfactual consumption levels can help quantify benefits derived from retrofit investments

# Objective
Predict future building energy consumption by modelling on past historical data.

# Prerequisites
You need to have installed following softwares and libraries before running this project.

1. Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and scipy: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

# Getting Started
Start by downloading the project files and run the ".ipynb" file as a ipython-notebook (Jupyter notebook)
